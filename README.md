**REMEZ** is a web application designed to identify and visualize risk signals for pharmaceutical drugs using data-driven analysis.  
It provides valuable insights by analyzing post-marketing surveillance data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).

This project reimplements the logic from [faers-analysis](https://github.com/Boris-Gorelik/faers-analysis) by Dr. Boris Gorelik, adapting the original CSV-based computations into a scalable, queryable database-backed approach.
