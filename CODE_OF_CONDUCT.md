# REMEZ Code of Conduct

Like the technical community as a whole, the REMEZ team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission â€” including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.

Diversity is one of our greatest strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and misunderstandings. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, mentors, and those seeking help and guidance.

This isnâ€™t an exhaustive list of things that you canâ€™t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which itâ€™s intended â€” a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the REMEZ project or its governing body in **Israel**. This includes discussion forums, mailing lists, the issue tracker, project events, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

## Our Standards

- **Be friendly and patient.**  
- **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.  
- **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by others, and your decisions will affect them.  
- **Be respectful.** Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior.  
- **Be professional.** Use respectful language and avoid insults or personal attacks.  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include (but are not limited to):  
- Violent threats or language directed against another person  
- Discriminatory jokes and language  
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material  
- Doxing (publishing othersâ€™ private information without consent)  
- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms  
- Unwelcome sexual attention  
- Encouraging or advocating any of the above behavior  
- Repeated harassment of others (if someone asks you to stop, stop)

## Handling Disagreements

Disagreements â€” both social and technical â€” happen all the time, and REMEZ is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that our strength comes from diversity. Different people have different perspectives; being unable to understand someoneâ€™s viewpoint doesnâ€™t make it wrong. Instead of blaming each other, focus on resolving issues and learning from mistakes.

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They may take any action deemed appropriate, including warnings, temporary suspension, or permanent removal from the community.
